<h3>Blackjack Rules</h3>

<h4>The Objective</h4>
<p> 
	The main objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 without going over.
	You win the round if you have a higher score than the dealer, or you get 21 exactly. If the dealer
	has a higher score than you, you lose the round.
</p>
<h4>Betting</h4>
<p>
	Before the cards are delt, you will be able to place a bet by pressing one of the three options of 
	money shown on the buttons. Once you place your bet, the dealing will begin.
</p>
<h4>The Dealing</h4>
<p>
	When your bet is placed, you will be dealt 2 cards, and the dealer will be dealt 2 cards. One of the 
	dealers cards will be face down. Both of your cards will be face up. It is at this point where you
	decide how you want to play your hand. One thing worth noting: aces can be counted as either 11
	or 1, depending on if you would bust or not. 
</p>
<h4>Playing</h4>
<p>
	Once you see your cards, you can choose to either hit, which is when you will be given another card
	to try and increase your score. Or, you can decide to stand, which is when you will keep your cards
	and try to beat the dealer with your current hand. If you go over 21, you will "bust", meaning you 
	will lose the round. 
</p>
<h4>The Dealer's Play</h4>
<p>
	Once you have decided your hand, the dealers card will be turned face up, revealing his score.
	If the total is 17 or more, the dealer must stand. If the total is 16 or under, the dealer will
	automatically hit. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to more 
	than 17, the dealer must count that ace as 11 and stand.
